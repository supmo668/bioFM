Project root: `/Users/mo/github/personal/bioFM`
Project: `bioFM` — A living monorepo workspace for Biological Foundation Models (DNA, RNA, protein, single-cell, multimodal) that pairs a curated research landscape (MODELS.md, a test-time compute primer, pinned upstream submodules) with runnable Python packages: a test-time compute scaling library for BioFM-265M, a 5-agent propose-critique-vote orchestrator (cellforge-agents), and the paper-bearing perturb-seq-eval project on Bayesian agentic hyperparameter tuning.
Languages: `bib, html, json, jsonl, makefile, markdown, python, tex, toml, yaml`
Batch: `22/28`
Skill directory (for bundled scripts): `/Users/mo/.claude/plugins/cache/understand-anything/understand-anything/2.8.0/skills/understand`
Output: write to `/Users/mo/github/personal/bioFM/.understand-anything/intermediate/batch-22.json` (single-file mode) OR `batch-22-part-<k>.json` (split mode, per Step B of your output protocol).

**IMPORTANT — output file naming:** the output file MUST be named exactly `batch-22.json` (or `batch-22-part-<k>.json`). Any other name is silently dropped by the merge script.

> **Language directive**: Generate all textual content (summaries, descriptions, tags, titles, languageNotes, languageLesson) in **English**. Maintain technical accuracy while using natural, native-level phrasing in the target language. Keep technical terms in English when no standard translation exists (e.g., "middleware", "hook", "barrel").

Pre-resolved import data for this batch (use directly — do NOT re-resolve imports from source):
```json
{
 "research/MODELS.md": [],
 "research/PUBLICATION_EVIDENCE.md": [],
 "research/PUBLISHING_RUNBOOK.md": [],
 "research/PUBLISHING_VENUES.md": [],
 "research/RELEASE_SOCIAL.md": []
}
```

Cross-batch neighbors with their exported symbols (confidence boost for cross-batch edges):
```json
{}
